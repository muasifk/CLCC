## Getting Started
The list of files and their description is explained as follows:

### Directories
💼 checkpoints: contains checkpoints crated during training
💼 figures: contained figures e.g., predictions, pacing functions etc.
💼 models: contains complete models.
💼 weights:  contains model weights as dictionaries.

### Files (used in standard training)
💻 cc_cl.ipynb:  The main notebook to train and test models. You can run all experiments using this notebook while changing parameters such as dataset, crowd model, training iterations etc.
💻 cc_load_data.py:  python function to load dataset.
💻 cc_trainer: trainer function using standard training.
💻 train.py: training loop implementation.
💻 validate.py:  validation loop implementation
💻 CrowdDataset.py:  Python class to create dataset.
💻 cc_utils.py: Utilities functions e.g., display image, prediction, etc.

### Files (used in Curriculum Learning)
💻 cc_cl_trainer:  trainer function using Curriculum Learning.
💻 get_pacing_function:  function to chose pacing function.
💻 sort_data:  scoring function to sort data by difficulty.
